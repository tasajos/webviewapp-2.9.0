## Android Studio & SDK

This chapter describes how to install Android Studio and Android SDK. You don't have to install Android Studio, but it's better. The project can be built without Android Studio, using Gradle and Android SDK. Gradle is a build system used for building a final APK file.

1. Install [Android Studio with Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio/)
2. Run Android SDK Manager and [download necessary SDK packages](https://developer.android.com/studio/intro/update#sdk-manager), make sure that you have installed Android SDK Tools, Android SDK Platform-Tools, Android SDK Build-Tools, Android Emulator and Google USB Driver
3. Now you should be able to open/edit the Android project and build an APK

## Configuration

This chapter describes how to configure the project to be ready for publishing. All these steps are very important!

If you are stuck and need help, try to [search the problem in comments](https://codecanyon.net/item/universal-android-webview-app/8431507/comments) on CodeCanyon. Most of the problems have already been discussed so there is a good chance that you will find the answer to your question there. You can also use [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) to find answers to your technical questions, resolve issues and bugs.


### 1. Import

Unzip the package and import/open the project in Android Studio. Choose "Import project" on Quick Start screen and select "webviewapp-x.y.z" directory.

You can [switch to Project view](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/#ProjectView) in the Project window on left if you want to see the actual file structure of the project including all files hidden from the Android view. Just select Project from the dropdown at the top of the Project window.

If you want, you can build and run the app right away to test it. Connect your device or [emulator](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds) to your computer. Make sure you have installed all necessary [drivers](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/oem-usb) for your Android device and you also enabled [USB debugging in Developer options](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device). To build and run the app in Android Studio, just click on Main menu -> Run -> Run 'mobile'. Choose a connected device and confirm.


### 2. Set Purchase Code

Open configuration file _mobile/src/main/java/com/robotemplates/webviewapp/WebViewAppConfig.java_ and set value of `PURCHASE_CODE` constant to your own [Envato purchase code](https://help.market.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/202822600-Where-Is-My-Purchase-Code-).

You are licensed to use this code to create one single end product for yourself or for one client (a "single application"). If you want to publish more than one app on Google Play, you have to buy more licenses. You have to buy a [License](https://codecanyon.net/licenses/terms/regular) for each end product. If you are going to sell your app, you will have to buy an [Extended License](https://codecanyon.net/licenses/terms/extended). The Extended License is required if end user must pay to use end product. Please read the [license terms](https://codecanyon.net/licenses/standard?license=regular) for more info.


### 3. Rename Application ID

Every Android app has a unique [application ID](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/application-id). This ID uniquely identifies your app on the device and in Google Play Store. If you want to upload a new version of your app, the application ID (and the [certificate you sign it with](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing)) must be the same as the original APK. If you change the application ID, Google Play Store treats the APK as a completely different app. So once you publish your app, you should never change the application ID. Default application ID is "chakuy.tsf2022" so you have to rename it to something else.

1. Open the main build script _mobile/build.gradle_ and rename the value of `applicationId`. Just rewrite it to your own application ID, e.g. "com.mycompany.myapp".
2. If you try to build the project now, you will probably get "No matching client found for package name..." error. The reason for this is that declared package names in _mobile/google-services.json_ don't match to your own package name (application ID). We will setup Firebase and _google-services.json_ later. In the meantime, if you want to get rid of the error, just update values of all `package_name` attributes in _google-services.json_ to your own package name (application ID), e.g. "com.mycompany.myapp".
3. Synchronize the project. Main menu -> File -> Sync Project with Gradle Files.


### 4. Rename Application Name

Open _mobile/src/main/res/values/strings.xml_ and change "WebView App" to your own name. Change _app\_name_ and _navigation\_header\_title_ strings.


### 5. Create Launcher Icon

Right click on _mobile/src/main/res_ directory -> New -> Image Asset -> Icon Type "Launcher Icons", Name "ic\_launcher", create the icon as you wish, you can set clipart, text, shape, color etc. -> Next -> Finish.

You can also change the icon by replacing _ic\_launcher.png_ file in _mipmap-mdpi_, _mipmap-hdpi_, _mipmap-xhdpi_, _mipmap-xxhdpi_, _mipmap-xxxhdpi_, _mipmap-anydpi-v26_ directories.

You can also change the logo shown in the navigation drawer header. It is stored in _mobile/src/main/res/drawable-nodpi/navigation\_header\_logo.png_.

You can also change the splash screen logo. It is stored in _mobile/src/main/res/drawable-nodpi/splash.png_.

**Tip:** Another possibility is to create the launcher icons using [Android Asset Studio](https://romannurik.github.io/AndroidAssetStudio/icons-launcher.html).


### 6. Choose Color Theme

Open _mobile/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml_ and change the value of `application.android:theme` attribute. There are 10 themes you can use:

* Theme.WebViewApp.Blue
* Theme.WebViewApp.Brown
* Theme.WebViewApp.Gray
* Theme.WebViewApp.Green
* Theme.WebViewApp.Lime
* Theme.WebViewApp.Orange
* Theme.WebViewApp.Purple
* Theme.WebViewApp.Red
* Theme.WebViewApp.Teal
* Theme.WebViewApp.Violet


### 7. Setup Navigation and Web Pages

Open _mobile/src/main/res/values/navigation.xml_. There are 4 string arrays:

* List of titles in the navigation drawer menu.
* List of webview URLs. You can specify URL link to a web page on the Internet or URL link to a local page stored in _assets_ directory. Local page does not require Internet connection. URL to the local page must be in this format: `file:///android_asset/example.html`. Use `{FCM_REGISTRATION_TOKEN}` or `{ONE_SIGNAL_USER_ID}` tags if you want to insert the FCM registration token or the OneSignal user id. If you want to add a category, leave the item empty. Menu item without URL is considered as a category item.
* List of icons in the navigation drawer menu.
* List of share messages. Each webview page can be shared via e-mail, sms, social networks etc. Share button is in the action bar. You can specify a message which will be posted. Use `{TITLE}` or `{URL}` tags if you want to insert a title or a URL link of the page. If you don't want to share the page, keep the item empty.

You can add/remove/modify menu items as you need. If you want to use local pages, copy HTML files to _mobile/src/main/assets_ directory and set proper paths in _navigation\_url\_list_ array. See the path format above.

**Note:** Main home page is the first page in the list of URLs. This page is loaded even if the navigation drawer is disabled.

**Important:** Each of these 4 arrays must contain the same number of items.


### 8. Setup Firebase Cloud Messaging and Analytics

Application uses [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for Cloud Messaging, Analytics and AdMob. You need to create a new Firebase account if you don't have one. You have to create a new project in [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/). Follow [Firebase documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup) to setup the project. After you add a new Firebase project, open it, select Analytics Dashboard and open wizard to add Firebase to your Android app. Fill in your package name (application ID) and download the _google-services.json_ config file. Copy this file into _mobile_ directory. That's it. You don't have to setup the Firebase SDK, it's already done. You can compose and send push notifications in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).

When user taps on a notification, the app is opened and home page is loaded. If you want to load a specific page, you have to send the notification with additional data. Open Firebase -> Cloud Messaging -> New message -> Additional options -> Custom data -> set "url" as a key and your link as a value.

You can change the icon of push notification by replacing _ic\_stat\_notification.png_ files in _drawable-mdpi_, _drawable-hdpi_, _drawable-xhdpi_, _drawable-xxhdpi_, _drawable-xxxhdpi_ directories.

**Tip:** You can target push notification messages on specific users by passing the FCM registration token in the webview URL. See _Setup Navigation and Web Pages_ chapter for more info.


### 9. Setup OneSignal

There are 2 options how to send push notifications: via Firebase Console or using OneSignal. If you prefer to use OneSignal, read following instructions, otherwise you can skip this step and use just Firebase Console which is simpler.

Application supports [OneSignal.com](https://onesignal.com/) for sending push notifications. You need to create a new OneSignal account if you don't have one. You have to create a new project in [OneSignal admin](https://onesignal.com/). OneSignal actually uses Google's [FCM technology](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/) (Firebase Cloud Messaging) so you must have Firebase account if you want to use OneSignal. Follow [OneSignal documentation](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/generate-a-google-server-api-key) to setup the project. You need to get a "Sender ID" (project number) and "Server key" in the Firebase Console. Everything is described step by step in the OneSignal documentation. When you are done, just paste the "Server key" and the "Sender ID" in OneSignal admin in the configuration wizard. Then open _mobile/src/main/res/values/onesignal.xml_ and set value of `onesignal_app_id` string. You can get `onesignal_app_id` value from OneSignal admin (Keys & IDs section). Leave this string empty if you don't want to use OneSignal. Empty means `<string name="onesignal_app_id" translatable="false"></string>`.

When user taps on a notification, the app is opened and home page is loaded. If you want to load a specific page, you have to send the notification with additional data. Open [OneSignal admin](https://onesignal.com/) -> New Message -> Launch URL -> set the link. Other alternative is New Message -> Advanced Settings -> Additional Data -> set "url" as a key and the link as a value. Both variants have the same result - the app will be opened with the specified URL.

You can change the icon of OneSignal push notification by replacing _ic\_stat\_onesignal\_default.png_ files in _drawable-mdpi_, _drawable-hdpi_, _drawable-xhdpi_, _drawable-xxhdpi_, _drawable-xxxhdpi_ directories.

**Tip:** You can target push notification messages on specific users by passing the OneSignal user id in the webview URL. See _Setup Navigation and Web Pages_ chapter for more info.


### 10. Setup AdMob

Open _mobile/src/main/res/values/admob.xml_ and set values of `admob_publisher_id` string to your own AdMob publisher id and `admob_app_id` string to your own AdMob app id. Default values are test publisher id and test app id. Keep the default values if you do not want to use AdMob. Set values of `admob_unit_id_banner` and `admob_unit_id_interstitial` strings to your own unit ids (banner id and interstitial id). Leave these strings empty if you don't want to use AdMob. Empty means `<string name="admob_unit_id_banner" translatable="false"></string>`.

You can also specify your test device id in `admob_test_device_id` string and use test mode when you are debugging the app. Requesting test ads is recommended when you are testing your application on a real device so you do not request invalid impressions. You can find your hashed device id in Android Monitor (Logcat) output by requesting an ad when debugging on your device. Open Android Monitor (Logcat) in Android Studio and look for "To get test ads on this device, call adRequest.addTestDevice("XXXXXX…");". You can use filter/search to find this information in the log. That XXX string is the hashed device id. This applies only to real devices, not emulators. Emulators are considered as test devices by default so you don't have to care about it.

Interstitial ad will be shown after each x url loadings or clicks on the navigation drawer menu. Frequency of showing AdMob interstitial ad can be changed. Open configuration file _mobile/src/main/java/com/robotemplates/webviewapp/WebViewAppConfig.java_ and set value of `ADMOB_INTERSTITIAL_FREQUENCY` constant.

This app is GDPR (European Union's General Data Protection Regulation) compliant. GDPR consent form is shown to users located in the European Economic Area during the first launch of the app. Users can choose if they want to personalize ads or not. GDPR consent form requires a URL link to your privacy policy. You can specify the link in `GDPR_PRIVACY_POLICY_URL` constant. Leave the constant empty if you don't want to show GDPR consent form. Empty means `public static final String GDPR_PRIVACY_POLICY_URL = "";`. Privacy policy link should be also provided within the app (e.g. in the navigation menu) because Google Play requires developers to provide a valid privacy policy when the app requests or handles sensitive user or device information (e.g. advertising identifier). You can use [privacy policy generator](https://app-privacy-policy-generator.firebaseapp.com/).

Don't forget to link your app to Firebase in the [AdMob settings](https://apps.admob.com/).

**Note:** Sometimes happens that there is no ad shown in the app. There is nothing wrong, it is correct behavior. If you see _Failed to load ad: 0_ in the log, it means that the ad is newly created. It will take some time to fetch ads from Google servers. You just need to wait a few hours. If you see _Failed to load ad: 3_ in the log, it means that your ad request was successful but Google server was not able to provide any ads for the target user.


### 11. Create Signing Keystore

You need to create your own keystore to [sign an APK/AAB file](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing) before [publishing the app on Google Play](https://developer.android.com/distribute/best-practices/launch/). You can create the keystore in [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#generate-key) or via [keytool utility](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/tools/solaris/keytool.html).

1. Easiest way is to create the keystore directly in Android Studio. Main menu -> Build -> Generate Signed Bundle / APK -> APK -> Create new. Keystore file name has to be _webviewapp.jks_ and must be stored in _extras/keystore_ directory. After you create the keystore file, you can just close the Generate Signed Bundle or APK dialog.
2. Make sure that newly created _webviewapp.jks_ is stored in _extras/keystore_ directory.
3. Open _extras/keystore/webviewapp.properties_ and set keystore alias and passwords which you chose in step 1.
4. Done. Remember that _webviewapp.jks_ and _webviewapp.properties_ are automatically read by Gradle script when creating a release APK via _assembleRelease_ command or AAB via _bundleRelease_ command. Paths to these files are defined in _gradle.properties_.

**Note:** If you want to create the keystore via keytool utility, run following command: `keytool -genkey -v -keystore webviewapp.jks -alias <your_alias> -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 36500` where `<your_alias>` is your alias name. For example your company name or app name. Keytool utility is part of Java JDK. On Windows, you can find it usually in _C:\Program Files\Java\jdkX.Y.Z\bin_. On Mac, you can find it usually in _/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdkX.Y.Z/Contents/Home/bin_. If you create the keystore this way, don't forget for step 2 and 3 above.

**Important:** Don't lose the keystore file, otherwise you will not be able to publish new updates on Google Play. You must use the same certificate throughout the lifespan of your app in order for users to be able to install new versions as updates to the app. Optionally, you can use [Google Play App Signing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuaYhnGmeEk) to avoid losing your keystore.


## Customization

This chapter describes optional customizations of the app.


### Action Bar

You can enable/disable action bar (toolbar) in the configuration file. Just open _mobile/src/main/java/com/robotemplates/webviewapp/WebViewAppConfig.java_ and set `ACTION_BAR` constant to true/false.

Title in the action bar is loaded from _mobile/src/main/res/values/navigation.xml_ file. If you want to show an HTML title rather than a navigation title in the action bar, then set `ACTION_BAR_HTML_TITLE` constant in the configuration file to true.


### Navigation Drawer Menu

You can enable/disable navigation drawer menu in the configuration file. Just open _mobile/src/main/java/com/robotemplates/webviewapp/WebViewAppConfig.java_ and set `NAVIGATION_DRAWER` constant to true/false.

You can enable/disable background image in the header of the navigation drawer menu. Just open _mobile/src/main/java/com/robotemplates/webviewapp/WebViewAppConfig.java_ and set `NAVIGATION_DRAWER_HEADER_IMAGE` constant to true/false. If it is disabled, accent color will be used for the background. Background image is stored in _mobile/src/main/res/drawable-nodpi/navigation\_header\_bg.png_. Logo shown in the header is stored in _mobile/src/main/res/drawable-nodpi/navigation\_header\_logo.png_.

You can also enable/disable menu icon tint. Just open _mobile/src/main/java/com/robotemplates/webviewapp/WebViewAppConfig.java_ and set `NAVIGATION_DRAWER_ICON_TINT` constant to true/false. Only transparent PNG icons can be tinted so if you don't use transparent icons, it is recommended to disable icon tint. Tint color is defined in _@color/navigation\_icon\_tint_ attribute in _mobile/src/main/res/values/colors.xml_.


### Exit Confirmation

You can enable/disable exit confirmation dialog (when user tries to exit the app by pressing the back button) in the configuration file. Just open _mobile/src/main/java/com/robotemplates/webviewapp/WebViewAppConfig.java_ and set `EXIT_CONFIRMATION` constant to true/false.


### Geolocation

Application supports geolocation. Keep in mind, that some users might have geolocation disabled on their device. Geolocation requires a permission to access GPS. Permission request is shown when it's necessary. If user decides to reject the permission, geolocation will not work. If you don't use geolocation on your web, it is better to disable it. You can enable/disable geolocation in the configuration file. Just open _mobile/src/main/java/com/robotemplates/webviewapp/WebViewAppConfig.java_ and set `GEOLOCATION` constant to true/false.

Also keep in mind, that HTML5 geolocation is not allowed anymore with insecure HTTP protocol for security reasons. It is recommended to use secure HTTPS protocol. See [Deprecating Powerful Features on Insecure Origins](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security/deprecating-powerful-features-on-insecure-origins) for more info.


### Progress Placeholder

You can enable/disable progress placeholder (shown when loading a first page) in the configuration file. Just open _mobile/src/main/java/com/robotemplates/webviewapp/WebViewAppConfig.java_ and set `PROGRESS_PLACEHOLDER` constant to true/false.


### JavaScript API

Application provides rich JavaScript API which you can use to interact with the mobile app from your web using JavaScript. You can enable/disable JavaScript API in the configuration file. Just open _mobile/src/main/java/com/robotemplates/webviewapp/WebViewAppConfig.java_ and set `JAVA_SCRIPT_API` constant to true/false. It is recommended to disable the JavaScript API if you don't plan to use it for security reasons. JavaScript API provides following JavaScript functions:

```javascript
var applicationId = RoboTemplatesWebViewApp.getApplicationId();
var versionCode = RoboTemplatesWebViewApp.getVersionCode();
var versionName = RoboTemplatesWebViewApp.getVersionName();
var deviceAPILevel = RoboTemplatesWebViewApp.getDeviceAPILevel();
var deviceUniqueId = RoboTemplatesWebViewApp.getDeviceUniqueId();
var fcmRegistrationToken = RoboTemplatesWebViewApp.getFcmRegistrationToken();
var oneSignalUserId = RoboTemplatesWebViewApp.getOneSignalUserId();

RoboTemplatesWebViewApp.showToast(message);
RoboTemplatesWebViewApp.showSnackbar(message);
RoboTemplatesWebViewApp.showSnackbarWithButton(message, button);
RoboTemplatesWebViewApp.showDialog(title, message);
RoboTemplatesWebViewApp.openBrowser(url);
RoboTemplatesWebViewApp.openStore();
RoboTemplatesWebViewApp.share(subject, text);
RoboTemplatesWebViewApp.closeApp();
RoboTemplatesWebViewApp.sendOneSignalTag(key, value);
RoboTemplatesWebViewApp.showInterstitialAd();
```

**Important:** Be careful about using `showInterstitialAd()` function. Follow AdMob rules and don't use it too often.


### Pull-to-Refresh Gesture

You can enable/disable pull-to-refresh gesture in the configuration file. There are 3 modes. Open _mobile/src/main/java/com/robotemplates/webviewapp/WebViewAppConfig.java_ and set value of `PULL_TO_REFRESH` constant to ENABLED, DISABLED or PROGRESS. Set ENABLED to enable the gesture, set DISABLED to disable the gesture, set PROGRESS to disable the gesture and show only progress indicator.

**Tip:** If you have a problem with scrolling, try to disable the pull-to-refresh gesture. It usually resolves any scrolling issues.


### In-app Review Dialog

In-app review dialog is shown after each x url loadings or clicks on navigation drawer menu. Open _mobile/src/main/java/com/robotemplates/webviewapp/WebViewAppConfig.java_ file if you want to configure the in-app review dialog. Frequency of showing the dialog can be set in `INAPP_REVIEW_DIALOG_FREQUENCY` constant. Set frequency to 0 if you don't want to show the in-app review dialog. Keep in mind that the in-app review dialog might not show up. It's not guaranteed. Google Play enforces a time-bound quota on how often a user can be shown the review dialog. Therefore in-app review dialog shouldn't be shown too often. See [Google Play In-App Review API](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/in-app-review) for more info.


### Rate App Prompt

Rate my app prompt dialog is shown after each x launches of the app. Open _mobile/src/main/java/com/robotemplates/webviewapp/WebViewAppConfig.java_ file if you want to configure the rate app prompt. Frequency of showing the prompt can be set in `RATE_APP_PROMPT_FREQUENCY` constant. Set frequency to 0 if you don't want to show the rate app prompt. Duration of showing the prompt (in milliseconds) can be set in `RATE_APP_PROMPT_DURATION` constant.

**Tip:** It's recommended to use either the in-app review dialog or the rate app prompt, but not both at once.


### User Agent

You can set your custom user agent string for the webview. You can use this feature to distinguish if web page is loaded in a standard browser or in the webview. It can be useful in situations when you want to load a different CSS for the webview, hide AdSense ads, etc. This logic has to be implemented on your backend. Open configuration file _mobile/src/main/java/com/robotemplates/webviewapp/WebViewAppConfig.java_ and set value of `WEBVIEW_USER_AGENT` constant to your own user agent string. Leave the constant empty if you don't want to set custom user agent string. Empty means `public static final String WEBVIEW_USER_AGENT = "";`.


### Open Links in External Browser

If you click on some link in the webview, web page is opened directly in the webview by default. Pages can be opened in external browser. If you need this behavior, just open configuration file _mobile/src/main/java/com/robotemplates/webviewapp/WebViewAppConfig.java_ and set `OPEN_LINKS_IN_EXTERNAL_BROWSER = true`.

You can also set rules which links will be opened in an external browser and which ones will be loaded in an internal webview. Open configuration file _mobile/src/main/java/com/robotemplates/webviewapp/WebViewAppConfig.java_ and add/remove rules in `LINKS_OPENED_IN_EXTERNAL_BROWSER` or `LINKS_OPENED_IN_INTERNAL_WEBVIEW` arrays. If a URL link of a page contains a string from the array, it will be opened in external browser/internal webview. These rules have higher priority than `OPEN_LINKS_IN_EXTERNAL_BROWSER` option. For example "http://www.example.com/?target=blank" will be opened externally and "http://www.example.com/?target=webview" will be opened internally.


### Download Manager

This feature allows to download files from web into a device. Just click on a download link and the file will be automatically downloaded into the DOWNLOAD directory. File URL must have a specific format so the download manager can recognize it as a downloadable file. You can see progress of downloading in the notification panel.

By the default configuration, URL must ends with a supported extension (zip, pdf, mp3, avi etc.), e.g. _http://www.example.com/path/mediafile.mp3_. The default configuration also supports Google Drive and Dropbox links.

You can modify supported file extensions or expressions in the configuration file. Just open _mobile/src/main/java/com/robotemplates/webviewapp/WebViewAppConfig.java_ and add/remove file types or expressions in `DOWNLOAD_FILE_TYPES` array as you need. Entries in this array are [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression). If the webview URL matches with the regular expression, the file will be downloaded via download manager. Keep the array empty if you don't want to use the download manager.


### Intents in HTML

Application supports [Android Intents](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/intents-filters). You can add a special link to your HTML file and you will be able to run appropriate external app to perform some action. For example send an e-mail or call somebody. Following intents are supported (example URI):

* HTTP web page: http://android.com
* HTTPS web page: https://google.com
* E-mail: mailto:someone@example.com?subject=Hello
* Phone call: tel:+0123456789

* Map point: geo:50.087474,14.421206
* Map search: geo:0,0?q=Czech+Republic

These intents are also supported in the navigation menu.


### Splash Screen

Splash screen in this app is implemented as a [launch screen](https://material.io/design/communication/launch-screen.html) according to Material Design guidelines. Splash screen logo is stored in _mobile/src/main/res/drawable-nodpi/splash.png_.


### Custom Colors and Icons

You can customize colors in _mobile/src/main/res/values/colors.xml_.

There are 30 icons which you can use for navigation drawer menu. If you need to create an icon for navigation drawer menu, it is recommended to use [Android Asset Studio](https://romannurik.github.io/AndroidAssetStudio/index.html).


### Multi-Language Support

Create a new directory _mobile/src/main/res/values-xx_ where _xx_ is an [ISO 639-1 code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) of the language you want to translate. For example "values-es" for Spanish, "values-fr" for French, "values-de" for German etc. Copy strings.xml and navigation.xml from _mobile/src/main/res/values_ into the new directory. Now you can translate texts or use different URL links for specific languages. Language is automatically determined by the system device settings. If there is no match with _values-xx_ language, default language in _mobile/src/main/res/values_ is selected. See [Localizing with Resources](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/localization) for more info.


### Deep Links

Application supports simple deep links which are specified in _mobile/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml_ as an intent filter. Links have this format: `http://host/pathPattern` or `https://host/pathPattern`. Open _mobile/src/main/res/values/strings.xml_ and change _app\_deep\_link\_host_ and _app\_deep\_link\_path_ as you need.

The pathPattern attribute specifies a complete path that is matched against the complete path in the Intent object. It can contain asterisk wildcard `*` that matches a sequence of 0 to many occurrences of the immediately preceding character. A period followed by an asterisk `.*` matches any sequence of 0 to many characters.


### Uploading Files

Application supports uploading files from storage or camera. File picker requires a permission to access storage. Permission request is shown when some file is chose. If user decides to reject the permission, file upload will not work.

There is a known bug on Android 4.4 so the upload might not work properly on this version of Android. See official [Android Issue Tracker](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/36983532) for more info.


### Video in HTML

Application supports HTML5 video, YouTube, Vimeo, JW Player etc. in fullscreen mode.


### Antivirus False Positive

Some antivirus programs may find this app potentially dangerous. One of the reasons might be using JavaScript. If your app is detected as malicious, you should add it to antivirus white lists to avoid false positive issues. Usually you have to upload an APK file. You can report false positive findings here:

* [Avast](https://www.avast.com/false-positive-file-form.php)
* [AVG](https://secure.avg.com/submit-sample)
* [Avira](https://analysis.avira.com/en/submit)
* [Bitdefender](https://www.bitdefender.com/submit/)
* [Symantec](https://submit.symantec.com/false_positive/)
* [360 Total Security](https://www.360totalsecurity.com/en/suspicion/false-positive/)

## Building & Publishing

This chapter describes how to build an APK/AAB (Android App Bundle) file using Gradle and prepare the app for publishing. Android Studio uses Gradle for building Android applications. Publishing an app in APK format is simpler. [AAB (Android App Bundle)](https://developer.android.com/guide/app-bundle/) is a new format that supports dynamic delivery, but defers APK generation and signing to Google Play. It requires additional [setup of signing keystore](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/7384423) in Google Play.

You don't need to install Gradle on your system, because there is a [Gradle Wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html). The Wrapper is a batch script on Windows, and a shell script for other operating systems. When you start a Gradle build via the Wrapper, Gradle will be automatically downloaded and used to run the build.

1. Open the project in Android Studio.
2. Open the configuration file _mobile/src/main/java/com/robotemplates/webviewapp/WebViewAppConfig.java_ and check if everything is set up correctly.
3. Open the main build script _mobile/build.gradle_ and check version constants.
4. Run `gradlew assemble` for APK or `gradlew bundle` for AAB in Android Studio terminal. Make sure you are running the command from the root directory of the project.
5. After the build is finished, the APK/AAB file should be available in _mobile/build/outputs/apk/release_ or _mobile/build/outputs/bundle/release_ directory.

**Note:** You can also [create the APK/AAB file](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#sign-apk) via Main menu -> Build -> Generate Signed Bundle / APK. If you want to do it this way, just choose your keystore, enter your alias, passwords and generate the file. After the build is finished, the APK/AAB file should be available in _mobile/release_ directory.

**Note:** You will also need a "local.properties" file to set the location of the SDK in the same way that the existing SDK requires, using the "sdk.dir" property. Example of "local.properties" on Windows: `sdk.dir=C:\\adt-bundle-windows\\sdk`. Alternatively, you can set an environment variable called "ANDROID\_HOME". Android Studio will take care of it.

**Tip:** Command `gradlew assemble` builds both - debug and release APK. You can use `gradlew assembleDebug` to build debug APK. You can use `gradlew assembleRelease` to build release APK. Debug APK is signed by a debug keystore. Release APK is signed by your own keystore, stored in _/extras/keystore_ directory. The same applies to `gradlew bundle` command which generates AAB.

**Signing process:** Keystore passwords are automatically loaded from property file during building the release APK/AAB file. Path to this file is defined in "keystore.properties" property in "gradle.properties" file.


### Versioning

Open the main build script _mobile/build.gradle_. There are 4 important constants for defining version code and version name.

* VERSION\_MAJOR
* VERSION\_MINOR
* VERSION\_PATCH
* VERSION\_BUILD

Keep in mind that versions have to be incremental. See [Version Your App](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning) in Android documentation for more info.
